    <success title="Deployment Verification">
      <description>Successfully deployed and verified USAsset v1.1.0 with comprehensive testing</description>
      <key-practices>
        - Created systematic verification log (VERIFICATION_LOG_2025-09-02.md)
        - Tested all API endpoints methodically
        - Documented issues found and resolved
        - Updated changelog with deployment status
      </key-practices>
      <outcome>Complete deployment with documented proof of functionality</outcome>
    </success>

    <success title="Quality Issue Resolution">
      <description>Systematically resolved CI quality issues using todo-driven approach</description>
      <key-practices>
        - Used TodoWrite to track each type of lint error
        - Fixed React hooks violations by understanding rules deeply
        - Extracted helper functions to meet line length limits
        - Verified fixes incrementally
      </key-practices>
      <outcome>Clean CI pipeline with maintainable code structure</outcome>
    </success>

    <success title="React Hooks Debugging">
      <description>Resolved complex conditional hooks violation in useDebugState</description>
      <key-practices>
        - Identified root cause: hooks called after conditional return
        - Restructured to call ALL hooks before any returns
        - Maintained functionality while fixing violations
        - Used helper functions to reduce complexity
      </key-practices>
      <outcome>Fixed critical React rules violation while preserving features</outcome>
    </success>
