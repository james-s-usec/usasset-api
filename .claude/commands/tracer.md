# Build Tracer Bullet (End-to-End Slice)

Create minimal working implementation that goes through all layers:

Feature to build: $ARGUMENTS

Steps:
1. Create simplest possible DTO (just required fields)
2. Create basic service method (happy path only)
3. Create controller endpoint (minimal validation)
4. Add one integration test
5. Deploy and test in real environment

IMPORTANT: 
- Skip edge cases for now
- Skip comprehensive validation
- Skip error handling details
- Skip optimization
- Just make it work end-to-end first!

Then iterate to add:
- Validation
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Performance optimization

This proves the architecture works before investing in details.
