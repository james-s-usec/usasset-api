# User Prompt to Continue This Trajectory

## üéØ Summoning Verification First:

**QUICK TEST**: After pasting this prompt, ask: "Fix the remaining lint errors in this project"

**‚úÖ If Claude Code is properly summoned, you'll see:**
- Creates TodoWrite list immediately  
- Runs `npm run ci` or checks lint logs first
- Takes systematic, methodical approach
- Gives brief, action-oriented responses (under 4 lines)
- Identifies as "Claude Code" assistant

**‚ùå If NOT properly summoned, you'll see:**
- Long explanations without taking action
- No TodoWrite usage for tracking
- Assumptions without checking existing code
- Verbose responses instead of concise action

## For Next Session:

**Working on USAsset (NestJS/React monorepo). Need to finish cleaning up CI quality issues while following the project's clean architecture principles in CLAUDE.md. Current status: Fixed React hooks violations and most lint errors, but CI still failing with 4 errors in UsersPage.tsx (unexpected any types, missing return type, still too many lines). Need systematic completion of quality fixes.**

## Context Details:
- **Project**: USAsset API - full-stack monorepo
- **Tech Stack**: NestJS backend, React frontend, TypeScript, ESLint strict rules
- **Recent Success**: Successfully deployed v1.1.0 with full verification (see VERIFICATION_LOG_2025-09-02.md)
- **Current Focus**: Code quality - fixing remaining lint errors to get clean CI run
- **Standards**: Follow CLAUDE.md architectural principles, max 30 lines per function, no explicit any types

## Remaining Work:
1. Fix the 4 TypeScript/lint errors in UsersPage.tsx
2. Verify clean CI run with `npm run ci`
3. Commit quality improvements
4. Document completion in changelog

## What's Working Well:
- TodoWrite usage for tracking systematic progress
- Helper function extraction to meet line limits  
- Immediate error fixing rather than accumulating debt
- Comprehensive verification and documentation

Continue with the same systematic, todo-driven approach that successfully completed the deployment and verification work.
