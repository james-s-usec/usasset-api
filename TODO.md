### = Current Task
- [ ] **Build Frontend Docker Image** (IN PROGRESS)
  - Need to build with version info for deployment tracking
  - Expected completion: 2-3 minutes

### =Ë Remaining Pipeline Tasks
- [ ] **Login to Azure Container Registry**
  - Command: `az acr login --name usassetacryf2eqktewmxp2`
  - Verify authentication before pushing images

- [ ] **Tag and Push Images to ACR**
  - Backend: Tag c9c4ac0 and push to ACR
  - Frontend: Tag latest build and push to ACR

- [ ] **Deploy to Azure Container Apps**
  - Follow DEPLOYMENT_SOP.md step-by-step process
  - Update both backend and frontend container apps

- **Database**: Seeded with admin users (required for projects)
- **Docker Status**: PostgreSQL running on port 5433

## í Next Session Continuation
To continue deployment:
1. Run frontend Docker build (current task)
2. Login to ACR: `az acr login --name usassetacryf2eqktewmxp2`
3. Tag and push both images
4. Deploy using DEPLOYMENT_SOP.md process
5. Verify with health endpoints and create verification log

## =Ý Notes
- Canvas build time is normal (5-7 minutes) due to native compilation
- All lint/typecheck/build validation passing
- User requested this TODO for session continuity
- Deployment scripts may timeout but Azure continues in background
