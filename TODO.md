# Current Deployment Progress

## üöÄ Deployment Pipeline Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
- [x] **Backend Docker Image Built** (build c9c4ac0)
  - Successfully built with canvas native dependencies
  - Image includes all bulk operations functionality
  - Canvas compilation completed with Cairo, Pango, JPEG support
  - Build time: ~5-7 minutes (normal for native compilation)

- [x] **Bulk Operations Feature Complete**
  - ‚úÖ BulkActionsToolbar.tsx - Complete UI with selection management
  - ‚úÖ FileTable.tsx - Checkbox selection integration
  - ‚úÖ useFileOperations.ts - Bulk operation handlers
  - ‚úÖ Backend endpoints - /bulk/assign-project, /bulk/move-to-folder, /bulk/delete
  - ‚úÖ Database operations - Efficient updateMany queries

- [x] **Backend Deployed Successfully**
  - Deployed to Azure Container Apps at commit c9c4ac0
  - ACR login completed, image pushed successfully
  - Health endpoint verified working
  - Includes all bulk operations functionality

### üö® CRITICAL BLOCKER - Frontend TypeScript Errors
- [ ] **Fix Frontend TypeScript Strict Mode Violations** (BLOCKING ALL DEPLOYMENT)
  - FileManagement.tsx:151-153 - state.handleBulk* undefined, pass as props from useFileManagement hook
  - FileTable.tsx:1 - remove unused useMemo import (ESLint violation)
  - PDFViewer.tsx:71 - remove unused width variable (strict mode violation)  
  - DocumentsPage.tsx:124 - fix Grid component props mismatch
  - FileFilterBar.tsx:150,167,222,239,255 - fix Select onChange event handler types
  - **APPROACH**: Fix systematically, one file at a time, maintain strict TypeScript
  - **REQUIREMENT**: `npm run ci` MUST pass before any deployment attempt

### üìã Post-Fix Pipeline Tasks
- [ ] **Build Frontend Docker Image**
  - Use SOP with proper build args: VITE_APP_VERSION, VITE_BUILD_TIME, VITE_API_URL
  - Command per SOP: `docker build -f apps/frontend/Dockerfile --build-arg VITE_API_URL=https://usasset-backend.purpledune-aecc1021.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io -t frontend:$GIT_COMMIT .`

- [ ] **Deploy Frontend to Azure Container Apps**
  - Follow DEPLOYMENT_SOP.md exactly
  - Update usasset-frontend container app  
  - Verify deployment with health endpoints

## üéØ Ready for Production Features

### Bulk File Operations
**Feature Complete and Production Ready:**
- Bulk assign files to projects
- Bulk move files to folders  
- Bulk delete files with confirmation
- Multi-select UI with "Select All" functionality
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Efficient database operations (updateMany)

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Frontend**: Material-UI Toolbar with Chip displays
- **Backend**: Three new endpoints with Swagger docs
- **Database**: Prisma updateMany for bulk efficiency
- **Security**: Validation and error handling throughout

## üîß Environment Information
- **Current Branch**: feature/leaflet-pdf-viewer
- **Current Commit**: 0055659 (committed with TS error details)
- **Backend Build**: c9c4ac0 (DEPLOYED - includes canvas + bulk operations)
- **Frontend Status**: TypeScript errors blocking build
- **Database**: Seeded with admin users (required for projects)
- **Docker Status**: PostgreSQL running on port 5433

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Session Priority
**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: Fix frontend TypeScript errors before any deployment
1. Fix the 5 specific TypeScript violations listed above
2. Run `npm run ci` to verify all checks pass
3. Only then proceed with frontend Docker build per SOP
4. Deploy frontend following DEPLOYMENT_SOP.md
5. Verify both frontend and backend working together

## üìù Critical Notes
- **Backend is LIVE and WORKING** at c9c4ac0 with bulk operations
- Frontend build FAILED due to TypeScript strict mode violations
- Must fix TypeScript errors systematically following project principles
- No shortcuts, no 'any' types - maintain code quality standards
- Commit message contains detailed fix instructions for next session

othing thing:   Summary

  The Problem: Prisma's Decimal fields were causing [DecimalError] Invalid argument: undefined when using
  plainToInstance() from class-transformer.

  Root Cause: When Prisma returns Decimal objects or null values, class-transformer's automatic type conversion
  tries to create Decimal instances but fails when encountering undefined during the transformation process.

  The Solution:
  1. Pre-process Decimal fields in the controller before DTO transformation
  2. Convert Prisma Decimals to plain numbers using parseFloat(value.toString())
  3. Handle null values explicitly by converting them to null instead of undefined
  4. Remove problematic @Transform decorators that were causing additional transformation conflicts

  Result: The /api/assets endpoint now works correctly and returns properly formatted asset data without Decimal
  transformation errors.

  The assets API is now working! You can continue with your PDF viewer testing or asset management features.
