# Azure Deployment Verification Log
**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Deployment Version**: 6936680  
**Commit**: fix: resolve infinite re-renders and log spam issues

## 🎯 Deployment Summary
- **Frontend**: ✅ https://usasset-frontend.purpledune-aecc1021.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/
- **Backend**: ✅ https://usasset-backend.purpledune-aecc1021.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/
- **Status**: Both containers deployed successfully

## 🔍 Issues Identified During Verification

### ✅ Issue #1: Projects API Requires Query Parameters (RESOLVED)
**Initial Problem**: `GET /api/projects` returned 404 Not Found

**Root Cause**: API requires pagination query parameters (page, limit)

**Resolution**: ✅ **Projects API works perfectly when called correctly**:
```bash
$ curl -s "https://usasset-backend.purpledune-aecc1021.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/api/projects?page=1&limit=10"
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "data": [
      {
        "id": "39596722-841e-4b63-85ca-f01fc00e389e",
        "name": "Test Project",
        "description": "Test project creation", 
        "status": "DRAFT"
      }
    ],
    "total": 1
  }
}
```

**Evidence - Other endpoints work**:
```bash
$ curl -s https://usasset-backend.purpledune-aecc1021.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/api/users
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "users": [...],  # Returns 3 users successfully
    "pagination": {...}
  }
}
```

### ❌ Issue #2: Backend Lint Error (Fixed)
**Problem**: Backend lint failing due to multiple classes in one file
```
/home/james/projects/usasset-api/apps/backend/src/features/projects/dto/project-member.dto.ts
  1:1  error  File has too many classes (2). Maximum allowed is 1  max-classes-per-file
```

**Resolution**: ✅ Separated `UserInfoDto` into `/dto/user-info.dto.ts`

### ✅ Verified Working Components

#### Backend Health Check
```bash
$ curl -s https://usasset-backend.purpledune-aecc1021.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/health

    "timestamp": "2025-09-02T23:45:22.156Z", 
    "uptime": 19067,
    "environment": "development",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```
