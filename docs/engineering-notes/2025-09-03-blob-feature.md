# Engineering Notes - 2025-09-03

## Morning Standup
- Yesterday: N/A (first day tracking)
- Today: Implement file preview features for blob storage
- Blockers: None

## Work Log

### 09:30 - Azure Blob Storage Configuration
**What**: Configured Azure Storage for local development environment
**Why**: Need file upload/storage capabilities for USAsset application
**How**: Added connection string to .env, integrated with NestJS backend
**Result**: Successfully connected to Azure Storage account `usassetstoragedev`
**Learned**: Connection string can be parsed for SAS token generation

### 09:45 - Blob Sync Service Implementation #solution
**What**: Created sync endpoint to reconcile Azure Blob Storage with local database
**Why**: New dev machine had orphaned blobs from previous deployments
**How**: Implemented `/api/files/sync` endpoint that:
  - Lists all blobs in Azure
  - Compares with database records
  - Adds missing blobs to DB
  - Marks deleted blobs
**Result**: Successfully synced 2 orphaned test files
**Learned**: KISS principle - simple sync beats complex state management

### 10:00 - Image Preview Feature Implementation
**What**: Added image preview functionality to file management system
**Why**: Users need to preview images without downloading
**How**: 
  - Backend: Created `/api/files/:id/view` endpoint with SAS token generation
  - Frontend: Added preview button to FileTableRow component
  - Created ImagePreviewDialog component for modal display
**Result**: Full image preview working with secure, time-limited URLs
**Learned**: SAS tokens provide secure, temporary access without exposing storage keys

### 10:30 - Code Quality Gate Fixes #problem #solution
**What**: Fixed all ESLint and TypeScript errors (NO BROKEN WINDOWS!)
**Why**: Maintain code quality standards, prevent technical debt
**How**: 
  - Refactored large functions (>30 lines) into smaller methods
  - Fixed TypeScript readonly property errors
  - Extracted ImagePreviewDialog component
  - Added proper return types
**Result**: All quality gates passing except minor frontend warnings
**Learned**: Breaking large functions improves readability AND satisfies linters

## Decisions Made

- **Decision**: Use SAS tokens for image URLs
  **Context**: Need secure image serving without exposing storage credentials
  **Options Considered**: 
    1. Direct blob URLs (insecure)
    2. Proxy through backend (performance overhead)
    3. SAS tokens (chosen)
  **Rationale**: SAS tokens provide time-limited, read-only access
  **Trade-offs**: Requires parsing connection string for credentials

- **Decision**: Implement sync endpoint instead of complex state management #decision
  **Context**: Database and blob storage can get out of sync
  **Options Considered**:
    1. Event-driven sync (complex)
    2. Manual sync endpoint (chosen)
    3. Scheduled sync job (overkill)
  **Rationale**: KISS/YAGNI - simple POST endpoint solves the problem
  **Trade-offs**: Manual trigger required, but that's fine for dev

## Code Reviews
- No PRs today - working directly on main branch

## Learning Notes
- TIL: Azure Blob Storage connection strings contain AccountName and AccountKey that can be parsed for SAS generation #learned
- Tool discovered: `rg` (ripgrep) is much better than `cat` + `grep` for searching logs  
- Pattern identified: Extract dialog components to reduce component size and improve reusability
- **CORS deep understanding**: Browser `fetch()` to external domains triggers CORS, but `<img src="">` doesn't #learned
- **TypeScript stream handling**: Azure Blob `readableStreamBody` can be `undefined`, requires null checking #learned
- **Response format consistency**: Backend has global response wrapper - all endpoints return `{success, data}` format #learned
- **Production sync issue**: Blob storage and database can get out of sync during deployments - refresh should always sync first #learned
- **Debugging methodology**: Always test API directly with curl before debugging frontend - isolates the issue layer #learned

### 16:30 - CSV Preview Feature Implementation #solution #learned
**What**: Completed full CSV preview functionality with secure content fetching
**Why**: Users needed to preview CSV files without downloading (continuation from morning TODOs)
**How**: 
  - Backend: Added `/api/files/:id/content` endpoint to fetch file content server-side
  - Frontend: Created CSV parser utility with 100-row limit
  - Added CSVPreviewDialog component with MUI Table (simple HTML table, not DataGrid per user request)
  - Updated FileTableRow to show preview button for CSV files
  - Fixed CORS issues by proxying through backend API
**Result**: Full CSV preview working - displays first 100 rows in clean table format
**Learned**: 
  - CORS only affects browser-to-server requests, not server-to-server
  - Backend global response wrapper requires frontend handling: `{success: true, data: {content: "..."}}`
  - Simple MUI Table is better than complex DataGrid for basic preview

### 16:45 - CORS Issue Deep Dive #problem #solution
**Issue**: Frontend couldn't fetch CSV content - CORS errors accessing Azure Blob Storage directly
**Debugging**: 
  1. Confirmed image preview works (uses SAS URLs in `<img>` tags)
  2. CSV preview fails (uses `fetch()` to blob URL)  
  3. Tested both approaches - JavaScript `fetch()` triggers CORS, `<img>` doesn't
**Solution**: Created backend proxy endpoint that fetches content server-side and returns to frontend
**Prevention**: Always proxy external service calls through backend API for security and CORS compliance

### 17:00 - Production Refresh Button Bug #problem #solution  
**Issue**: Production refresh button not showing all uploaded files (only 1 of 5 files visible)
**Debugging**:
  1. API test showed backend healthy, returning 1 file from database
  2. Manual sync endpoint returned: `{"added": 4, "marked_deleted": 0, "already_synced": 1}`
  3. Root cause: Refresh button only calls `GET /api/files` (database query), doesn't sync blob storage
**Solution**: Modified `fetchFiles()` to automatically call sync endpoint before database query
**Prevention**: Refresh operations should always reconcile external storage with database
**Learned**: Production blob storage can get out of sync with database during deployments #learned

## Tomorrow's Priority
1. **Deploy frontend fix to Azure** - refresh button blob storage sync
2. Add PDF preview capability (using embedded viewer or PDF.js) 
3. Add XLSX preview with sheet navigation
4. Test CSV preview with larger files and edge cases

## Technical Details for Next Session

### PDF Preview Requirements
- Use `<iframe>` or PDF.js library
- Show first page thumbnail
- Allow full document viewing in modal

### CSV Preview Requirements  
- Parse first 100 rows
- Display in Material-UI DataGrid
- Show column headers
- Handle large files gracefully

### XLSX Preview Requirements
- Use SheetJS or similar library
- Show sheet tabs
- Display active sheet in table format
- Support multiple sheets navigation

## Commands Used Today
```bash
# Azure Storage commands
az storage account list --resource-group useng-usasset-api-rg
az storage account show-connection-string --name usassetstoragedev
az storage blob list --container-name uploads --account-name usassetstoragedev

# Docker/Database
docker-compose up -d
docker ps | grep postgres
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Quality gates
npm run ci
npm run lint --workspace=backend
npm run typecheck --workspace=backend

# Better log searching (learned today!)
rg "error" .logs/backend-lint.log | tail -5
tail -20 .logs/backend-lint.log  # Instead of cat

# API testing (CSV preview)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/files/eaae7698-e9e1-4df9-8d2b-533a08942764/content
curl http://localhost:3000/api/files  # List files to get IDs
```

## Notes
- Frontend has file management at: http://localhost:5173/files
- Blob storage sync worked perfectly - added 2 orphaned files
- All backend functions now under 30 lines (clean architecture!)
- Image preview feature complete with security and proper UI
- **CSV preview now fully working** - shows first 100 rows in clean table format
- Preview buttons show for both images and CSV files automatically
- Backend API pattern: all file operations go through `/api/files/` endpoints for security
