# Engineering Notes - 2025-09-03

## Morning Standup
- Yesterday: N/A (first day tracking)
- Today: Implement file preview features for blob storage
- Blockers: None

## Work Log

### 09:30 - Azure Blob Storage Configuration
**What**: Configured Azure Storage for local development environment
**Why**: Need file upload/storage capabilities for USAsset application
**How**: Added connection string to .env, integrated with NestJS backend
**Result**: Successfully connected to Azure Storage account `usassetstoragedev`
**Learned**: Connection string can be parsed for SAS token generation

### 09:45 - Blob Sync Service Implementation #solution
**What**: Created sync endpoint to reconcile Azure Blob Storage with local database
**Why**: New dev machine had orphaned blobs from previous deployments
**How**: Implemented `/api/files/sync` endpoint that:
  - Lists all blobs in Azure
  - Compares with database records
  - Adds missing blobs to DB
  - Marks deleted blobs
**Result**: Successfully synced 2 orphaned test files
**Learned**: KISS principle - simple sync beats complex state management

### 10:00 - Image Preview Feature Implementation
**What**: Added image preview functionality to file management system
**Why**: Users need to preview images without downloading
**How**: 
  - Backend: Created `/api/files/:id/view` endpoint with SAS token generation
  - Frontend: Added preview button to FileTableRow component
  - Created ImagePreviewDialog component for modal display
**Result**: Full image preview working with secure, time-limited URLs
**Learned**: SAS tokens provide secure, temporary access without exposing storage keys

### 10:30 - Code Quality Gate Fixes #problem #solution
**What**: Fixed all ESLint and TypeScript errors (NO BROKEN WINDOWS!)
**Why**: Maintain code quality standards, prevent technical debt
**How**: 
  - Refactored large functions (>30 lines) into smaller methods
  - Fixed TypeScript readonly property errors
  - Extracted ImagePreviewDialog component
  - Added proper return types
**Result**: All quality gates passing except minor frontend warnings
**Learned**: Breaking large functions improves readability AND satisfies linters

## Decisions Made

- **Decision**: Use SAS tokens for image URLs
  **Context**: Need secure image serving without exposing storage credentials
  **Options Considered**: 
    1. Direct blob URLs (insecure)
    2. Proxy through backend (performance overhead)
    3. SAS tokens (chosen)
  **Rationale**: SAS tokens provide time-limited, read-only access
  **Trade-offs**: Requires parsing connection string for credentials

- **Decision**: Implement sync endpoint instead of complex state management #decision
  **Context**: Database and blob storage can get out of sync
  **Options Considered**:
    1. Event-driven sync (complex)
    2. Manual sync endpoint (chosen)
    3. Scheduled sync job (overkill)
  **Rationale**: KISS/YAGNI - simple POST endpoint solves the problem
  **Trade-offs**: Manual trigger required, but that's fine for dev

## Code Reviews
- No PRs today - working directly on main branch

## Learning Notes
- TIL: Azure Blob Storage connection strings contain AccountName and AccountKey that can be parsed for SAS generation #learned
- Tool discovered: `rg` (ripgrep) is much better than `cat` + `grep` for searching logs
- Pattern identified: Extract dialog components to reduce component size and improve reusability

## Tomorrow's Priority
1. Add PDF preview capability (using embedded viewer or PDF.js)
2. Add CSV preview with data table (first 100 rows)
3. Add XLSX preview with sheet navigation

## Technical Details for Next Session

### PDF Preview Requirements
- Use `<iframe>` or PDF.js library
- Show first page thumbnail
- Allow full document viewing in modal

### CSV Preview Requirements  
- Parse first 100 rows
- Display in Material-UI DataGrid
- Show column headers
- Handle large files gracefully

### XLSX Preview Requirements
- Use SheetJS or similar library
- Show sheet tabs
- Display active sheet in table format
- Support multiple sheets navigation

## Commands Used Today
```bash
# Azure Storage commands
az storage account list --resource-group useng-usasset-api-rg
az storage account show-connection-string --name usassetstoragedev
az storage blob list --container-name uploads --account-name usassetstoragedev

# Docker/Database
docker-compose up -d
docker ps | grep postgres
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Quality gates
npm run ci
npm run lint --workspace=backend
npm run typecheck --workspace=backend

# Better log searching (learned today!)
rg "error" .logs/backend-lint.log | tail -5
tail -20 .logs/backend-lint.log  # Instead of cat
```

## Notes
- Frontend has file management at: http://localhost:5173/files
- Blob storage sync worked perfectly - added 2 orphaned files
- All backend functions now under 30 lines (clean architecture!)
- Image preview feature complete with security and proper UI
