# Engineering Notes - 2025-09-03

## Morning Standup
- Yesterday: N/A
- Today: Implement minimal Asset management feature (tracer bullet approach)
- Blockers: None

## Work Log

### 14:33 - Asset Feature Implementation (Tracer Bullet)
**What**: Implemented complete CRUD API for Asset management with minimal fields (assetTag, name)
**Why**: Following tracer bullet approach to establish end-to-end functionality before expanding features
**How**: 
- Created Prisma schema with Asset model (3 fields: assetTag, name, audit fields)
- Generated migration and applied to database
- Created NestJS module with controller, service, DTOs following User feature patterns
- Implemented full CRUD endpoints with proper validation and error handling
**Result**: 
- ‚úÖ All 5 CRUD endpoints working (GET all, GET by ID, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- ‚úÖ Proper pagination support
- ‚úÖ Safe DTOs excluding sensitive audit fields
- ‚úÖ Soft delete implementation
- ‚úÖ Created test data: 2 assets in database
**Learned**: Copying established patterns (User feature) made implementation very fast and consistent

## Decisions Made
- **Decision**: Use simplified service structure instead of separate query/command services #decision
  **Context**: User feature has complex query/command separation for bulk operations
  **Options Considered**: Copy full User structure vs simplified single service
  **Rationale**: YAGNI principle - Asset feature doesn't need bulk operations initially
  **Trade-offs**: May need to refactor later if bulk operations needed

- **Decision**: Keep minimal 3-field schema for tracer bullet #decision
  **Context**: Asset management could have dozens of fields (location, owner, category, etc.)
  **Options Considered**: Full schema vs minimal schema
  **Rationale**: Tracer bullet approach - establish end-to-end flow first, expand incrementally
  **Trade-offs**: Will need schema migrations for additional fields later

## Code Reviews
- Self-reviewed: Asset API follows established architectural patterns from User feature

## Learning Notes
- TIL: NestJS CLI generates clean boilerplate but need to organize into proper directory structure #learned
- Pattern identified: User Feature MVP Blueprint is excellent template for new features #learned
- Tool discovered: Prisma migration workflow is very smooth for database changes #learned

## Next Steps (In Progress)
1. Create frontend AssetsPage component (following FilesPage pattern)
2. Add /assets route to React router
3. Test end-to-end functionality
4. Ensure all quality gates pass (lint, typecheck, tests)

## Quality Gates Status
- ‚úÖ Backend build successful
- ‚úÖ Database schema and migration applied
- ‚úÖ API endpoints tested and working
- üîÑ Frontend implementation in progress
- ‚è≥ End-to-end testing pending
- ‚è≥ CI pipeline validation pending

**Entry**: makes ure we pass all quality gates - Currently at 50% completion, backend fully working, frontend next.

### 18:45 - Asset Feature Frontend Complete (Tracer Bullet)
**What**: Completed end-to-end Asset management feature with Material-UI frontend
**Why**: Get working tracer bullet deployed before adding enhancements
**How**:
- Created AssetManagement component with Material-UI Table (not AG-Grid yet)
- Added AssetService for API calls using existing apiService
- Added /assets route to React router
- Implemented list and delete functionality (edit/add are placeholders)
**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Frontend renders asset list from API
- ‚úÖ Delete functionality works (soft delete)
- ‚úÖ Navigation to /assets page working
- ‚ùå ESLint errors need fixing (function too long, JSX nesting too deep)
- ‚ùå Edit/Add forms are placeholder alerts
**Learned**: Simple Material-UI table gets tracer bullet working faster than AG-Grid

## üîç Current Decision Point: What's Next?

### Option 1: Clean Up Quality Gates First üßπ
**Time**: 30 minutes
- Fix ESLint errors (function length, JSX depth) 
- Get CI green and deploy tracer bullet

### Option 2: Add More Fields üìù  
**Time**: 45 minutes
- Add description, status, location to schema
- Requires migration + DTO updates

### Option 3: Upgrade to AG-Grid üìä
**Time**: 60 minutes  
- Replace Material-UI table with AG-Grid
- Professional data grid experience

### Option 4: Add Create/Edit Forms üìù
**Time**: 45 minutes
- Complete CRUD functionality
- Material-UI dialogs with validation

## Quality Gates Status (Updated)
- ‚úÖ Backend build successful
- ‚úÖ Database schema and migration applied  
- ‚úÖ API endpoints tested and working
- ‚úÖ Frontend implementation complete (tracer bullet)
- ‚úÖ End-to-end functionality working (list/delete)
- ‚ùå CI pipeline validation failing (lint errors)

**Entry**: lets recor this work with 2025-09-03-asset-feature.md notes - Asset tracer bullet complete end-to-end, needs lint cleanup.

## Tomorrow's Priority
1. ~~Complete frontend Asset management UI~~ ‚úÖ DONE
2. Fix lint errors and get CI green
3. Deploy working tracer bullet to production
4. Choose next enhancement (AG-Grid, more fields, or full CRUD forms)
