## Morning Session - Frontend CI Fixes

### [03:00] - Frontend Lint Error Resolution
**What**: Massive frontend linting error cleanup session - reduced from 143 to 87 errors
**Why**: Following "NO BROKEN WINDOWS" principle - CI must pass completely
**How**: Systematic approach to fixing TypeScript types, refactoring large components, extracting sub-components
**Result**: 
- âœ… All `any` types eliminated and replaced with proper TypeScript types
- âœ… Build now passes successfully
- ðŸ“‰ 39% reduction in lint errors (143 â†’ 87)
- âœ… Major refactoring of BulkActionsToolbar (285 lines â†’ multiple smaller components)

**Learned**: 
- ESLint's auto-fix can handle many formatting issues but not architectural problems
- Breaking down large components requires creating multiple focused files
- Clean architecture principles (30 lines max, single responsibility) require aggressive refactoring

### Key Fixes Implemented

#### TypeScript Type Safety
- **Fixed all `any` type violations**:
  - Created proper interfaces for API responses (`FileResponse`, `PDFFile`)
  - Added AG-Grid types (`ICellRendererParams`, `GridReadyEvent`)
  - Fixed Leaflet type issues with custom interface
  - Added proper return types to async functions

#### Component Refactoring
- **BulkActionsToolbar breakdown** (285 lines â†’ modular):
  - Extracted `BulkProjectDialog.tsx`
  - Extracted `BulkFolderDialog.tsx` 
  - Extracted `BulkDeleteDialog.tsx`
  - Extracted `BulkActionsHeader.tsx`
  - Created sub-components for better organization
  - Added custom hooks for state management

- **Other refactoring**:
  - Extracted `ColumnMenu.tsx` from ColumnVisibilityControl
  - Fixed App.tsx NavigationBar (moved nav items outside component)

#### Build Errors Fixed
- Grid component props issues in DocumentsPage
- Asset data undefined checks in AssetGridManagement
- FileFolderView type narrowing for Project vs Folder

## Decisions Made

### Architecture Decision: Component Size Limits
**Context**: Many components exceeded 30-line limit by 100+ lines
**Options Considered**:
1. Increase limit in ESLint config (rejected - violates principles)
2. Disable rule for specific files (rejected - broken windows)
3. Aggressive refactoring into sub-components (chosen)
**Rationale**: Following clean architecture principles strictly
**Trade-offs**: More files, but each has single responsibility

### Pattern: Dialog Extraction
**Pattern**: Extract all dialogs into separate components with consistent props interface
```typescript
interface DialogProps {
  open: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  onConfirm: () => void;
  loading: boolean;
  // ... specific props
}
```

## Problems Encountered

### #problem Directory Navigation Issues
**Issue**: Lost track of current directory causing command failures
**Solution**: Always use absolute paths or check `pwd` first

### #problem String Replacement Failures
**Issue**: MultiEdit couldn't find exact strings due to formatting differences
**Solution**: Use smaller, more specific string matches or read exact text first

## Code Quality Metrics
- **Before**: 143 lint errors, build failing
- **After**: 87 lint errors, build passing
- **Components created**: 7 new files for better separation
- **Largest component**: Reduced from 285 lines to ~160 lines

## Remaining Work (87 errors)
1. Functions still too long (>30 lines) - biggest remaining issue
2. High complexity functions (>7 complexity score)
3. Missing return types on some functions
4. JSX depth violations (>4 levels nesting)
5. Some unescaped quotes in JSX

## Tomorrow's Priority
1. Continue component refactoring to get all functions under 30 lines
2. Reduce complexity by extracting business logic into hooks/helpers
3. Fix remaining JSX depth issues by creating more sub-components
4. **GOAL: Get CI to fully pass - NO BROKEN WINDOWS**

## Commands & Patterns Used
```bash
# Useful commands from session
npm run ci                    # Run full CI pipeline
npm run lint --workspace=frontend  # Lint just frontend
npx eslint . --fix           # Auto-fix formatting issues
rg "any" --glob "*.ts"       # Find all any types
```

## Key Learnings
- #learned AG-Grid requires specific type imports: `ICellRendererParams`, `GridReadyEvent`
- #learned React 18 Grid component changed API - use `size` prop not `item xs sm md`
- #learned ESLint can auto-fix ~10% of issues, rest need manual refactoring
- #learned Complexity score includes all branches, loops, and conditions

## Session Summary
Made significant progress on frontend code quality following strict clean architecture principles. While CI doesn't fully pass yet, we've eliminated all type safety issues and build errors. The remaining issues are all about code organization and complexity - exactly what the architecture principles are designed to address. The "no broken windows" philosophy means we must continue until CI passes completely.
