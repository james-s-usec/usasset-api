## Work Log

### 14:20 - ETL Jobs Management Tab Implementation
**What**: Added new "Jobs" tab to ETL Rules Management panel to display import job history and status
**Why**: User requested visibility into pipeline job execution history for debugging and monitoring
**How**: 
- Added backend API endpoint `GET /api/pipeline/jobs` to list recent import jobs
- Extended PipelineService with `listJobs()` method including proper TypeScript type mapping
- Added Material-UI Tabs component with Rules/Jobs tabs
- Implemented comprehensive jobs table with status, progress, timestamps, error counts
- Added ImportJob TypeScript interface for type safety
**Result**: Functional jobs tab displaying job history with color-coded status indicators
**Learned**: JSX structure debugging is much more efficient using `rg` to count opening/closing tags than manually reading files

### 14:25 - JSX Syntax Error Debugging Marathon #problem
**Issue**: Multiple JSX syntax errors - unmatched braces, missing closing tags, malformed conditional blocks
**Debugging**: 
- Used `rg -c "<Box"` and `rg -c "</Box>"` to count opening vs closing tags (14 vs 13)
- Found conditional blocks `{currentTab === 0 &&` and `{currentTab === 1 &&` needed proper closing
- Discovered JSX comment placement issues inside conditional blocks
**Solution**: 
- Systematically rebuilt file structure using efficient commands
- Used `sed` operations instead of manual edits
- Applied EFFICIENCY RULES: used `rg`/`grep` for pattern matching, avoided reading entire files
**Prevention**: Always count opening/closing tags when debugging JSX structure issues

### 14:30 - Efficient File Restructuring #learned
**What**: Rebuilt corrupted JSX file using command-line tools instead of manual editing
**How**: 
- Split file into logical sections: header, tabs content, dialog
- Used `head`, `sed -n 'start,end'`, and file concatenation
- Applied append operations instead of `cat` (user preference)
**Result**: Clean, properly structured JSX with balanced tags and correct nesting
**Learned**: Breaking complex file fixes into sections is more reliable than trying to fix in-place

## Decisions Made #decision
- **Decision**: Use backend API pagination for jobs list instead of frontend filtering  
  **Context**: Import jobs table could grow large over time
  **Rationale**: Database-level pagination is more performant and scalable
  **Trade-offs**: Slightly more complex API but better long-term performance

- **Decision**: Keep job status as color-coded chips rather than plain text
  **Context**: Visual status indicators improve user experience
  **Rationale**: Immediate visual feedback for job success/failure states
  **Trade-offs**: None - pure UX improvement

## Learning Notes #learned
- **TIL**: `rg -c "pattern"` for counting matches is much faster than manual inspection for JSX debugging
- **Tool discovered**: Using `sed -n 'start,endp'` to extract specific line ranges for file reconstruction
- **Pattern identified**: For JSX conditional blocks, always verify each opening `{condition && (` has matching `)}` 
- **Efficiency rule applied**: Never read entire files to check syntax - use pattern matching tools

## Technical Debt Addressed
- Fixed inconsistent error handling in pipeline API responses
- Standardized TypeScript interfaces for job data structures
- Cleaned up malformed JSX structure that was causing build failures

## Tomorrow's Priority
1. Test the Jobs tab functionality end-to-end with actual import job data
2. Add job filtering/search capabilities if requested
3. Consider adding job action buttons (retry, cancel) based on user needs

## Code Quality Notes
- Successfully applied EFFICIENCY RULES throughout debugging process
- Used systematic approach rather than trial-and-error for JSX fixes
- Maintained type safety throughout implementation with proper TypeScript interfaces
