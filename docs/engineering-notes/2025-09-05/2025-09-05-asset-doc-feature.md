# Engineering Notes - 2025-09-05

## Morning Standup
- Yesterday: Initial project scope documents work setup
- Today: Complete asset documentation feature implementation
- Blockers: Lint rule compliance, TypeScript configuration issues

## Work Log

### 14:30 - Asset Documentation Feature Implementation
**What**: Implemented complete asset documentation system with file uploads and structured notes
**Why**: Project requirements for asset-scoped document management and organized note-taking
**How**: Extended existing file management with new asset view mode and modular React components
**Result**: Fully functional asset documentation system with 8 file types and 6-field notes
**Learned**: Importance of modular component architecture for lint compliance

### 15:45 - Backend API Development #solution
**Issue**: Need asset-specific document endpoints and notes management
**Solution**: Created `/projects/{projectId}/assets/{assetId}/documents` and `/notes` endpoints
**Implementation**: 
- Extended documents.service.ts with asset context
- Added asset-notes.service.ts for 6-field structured notes
- Integrated file uploads with asset_id and file_type parameters
**Result**: Clean RESTful API following project conventions

### 16:20 - Frontend Component Architecture #learned
**What**: Built modular React components for asset document management
**Components Created**:
- AssetDocumentView (main container)
- AssetSelector (project/asset/file type selection)
- DocumentList (file display with actions)
- AssetNotesPanel (6-field accordion interface)
**Learned**: Breaking components into sub-components early prevents lint violations
**Pattern**: Use composition over large monolithic components

### 17:10 - Lint Compliance Challenge #problem
**Issue**: Multiple max-lines-per-function and complexity violations
**Debugging**: 
- Functions exceeded 30-line limit
- Arrow functions in components too large
- TypeScript return type annotations missing
**Solution**: 
- Split large functions into smaller helpers
- Created sub-components for complex UI sections
- Added explicit return type annotations
- Used composition pattern to reduce nesting
**Prevention**: Write smaller functions from the start, check lint frequently

### 17:45 - TypeScript Configuration Issues #problem
**Issue**: `export enum` syntax not allowed with `verbatimModuleSyntax`
**Debugging**: Build errors on FileType enum export
**Solution**: Converted enum to const assertion with type export:
```typescript
export const FileType = {
  DOCUMENT: 'DOCUMENT',
  // ...
} as const;
export type FileType = typeof FileType[keyof typeof FileType];
```
**Learned**: Modern TypeScript configs prefer const assertions over enums

### 18:15 - Database Verification #learned
**What**: Verified test data exists for comprehensive testing
**Found**:
- 6 users, 3 projects (Edwards Pavillion, Shaw Cancer Center, Wichita Animal Hospital)
- 6 assets with realistic names (Main Chiller Unit, MRI Cooling System, etc.)
- 22 existing files, 2 already associated with assets
- 3 assets with existing notes (Installation Notes, Maintenance Schedule, etc.)
**Learned**: Always check migration status before assuming database reset needed

## Decisions Made

### Component Architecture Pattern #decision
**Decision**: Use composition over inheritance for React components
**Context**: Lint rules enforce small functions and low complexity
**Options Considered**: 
- Large monolithic components with internal functions
- Hook-based logic separation
- Sub-component composition
**Rationale**: Sub-component composition provides best separation of concerns and lint compliance
**Trade-offs**: More files to maintain, but better maintainability and testability

### File Type Implementation #decision
**Decision**: Use const assertion instead of enum for FileType
**Context**: TypeScript verbatimModuleSyntax configuration requirement  
**Options Considered**:
- Traditional enum export
- String literal union type
- Const assertion with type derivation
**Rationale**: Const assertion provides type safety with modern TypeScript compliance
**Trade-offs**: Slightly more verbose but more compatible with strict configurations

### API Endpoint Structure #decision
**Decision**: Nested RESTful endpoints for asset documents
**Context**: Documents belong to specific assets within projects
**Pattern**: `/projects/{projectId}/assets/{assetId}/documents/{documentId}`
**Rationale**: Clear ownership hierarchy, follows REST conventions
**Trade-offs**: More complex URLs but clearer data relationships

## Testing Data Available
- **Projects**: Edwards Pavillion, Shaw Cancer Center, Wichita Animal Hospital
- **Assets**: 6 total with asset tags (HVAC-001, HVAC-002, ELEC-001, HVAC-101, MED-001, HVAC-201)
- **Existing Files**: 2 files already uploaded (test-spec.txt, test-manual.txt) to HVAC-201
- **Notes**: 3 assets have existing notes for testing the notes interface

## Code Quality Results
- **Frontend Build**: ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- **Backend API**: ✅ All endpoints functional and tested
- **Component Structure**: ✅ Modular architecture following lint rules
- **Database Schema**: ✅ Migrations current, test data populated

## Tomorrow's Priority
1. User testing of complete asset documentation workflow
2. Address any UX issues discovered during testing  
3. Performance testing with larger file uploads

## Features Completed Today
- ✅ Asset document upload/download/delete functionality
- ✅ 8-category file type system with color-coded badges
- ✅ 6-field structured asset notes with auto-save
- ✅ Responsive UI design (desktop/mobile)
- ✅ Complete API backend with proper validation
- ✅ TypeScript compilation and basic lint compliance
- ✅ Integration with existing file management system
