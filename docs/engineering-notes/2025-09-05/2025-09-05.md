# Engineering Notes - 2025-09-05

## Morning Standup
- **Yesterday**: Completed field mappings backend API implementation with CRUD operations
- **Today**: Frontend field mappings integration, testing, and ETL pipeline integration
- **Blockers**: None

## Work Log

### 09:30 - Field Mappings Frontend Integration
**What**: Integrated field mappings table with complete 129 asset fields from SafeAssetDto  
**Why**: Users need to map CSV headers to asset fields for ETL processing  
**How**: 
- Updated ASSET_FIELDS array with all 125 SafeAssetDto properties + core fields
- Fixed API response handling in useRulesLoader (was using custom fetch instead of apiService)
- Added comprehensive field mappings management UI
**Result**: Complete field mappings system operational with 129 fields
**Learned**: Command line tools (`grep`, `sed`, `wc -l`) are much faster than manual counting for large datasets

### 10:45 - Performance Optimization & Bug Fixes  
**What**: Fixed infinite re-render loop causing repeated API calls
**Why**: React component was making 100s of API calls per second
**How**: 
- Added `useCallback` to memoize functions in custom hooks
- Fixed useEffect dependencies to only depend on stable function references
- Prevented aliasManagement object recreation on every render
**Result**: Eliminated infinite loops, smooth UI performance
**Learned**: React hook dependency arrays must be carefully managed to prevent performance issues

### 11:30 - Code Quality & Documentation
**What**: ESLint compliance and comprehensive documentation  
**Why**: No broken windows policy - maintain clean, maintainable code
**How**:
- Decomposed large functions to satisfy max-lines-per-function: 30 rule
- Split complex JSX to meet jsx-max-depth: 4 requirement
- Created `/src/components/pipeline/components/CLAUDE.md` documentation
**Result**: Zero ESLint errors, well-documented system behavior
**Learned**: ESLint rules force better component architecture and readability

### 14:30 - Comprehensive Smoke Testing
**What**: Created comprehensive backend smoke test with error scenarios and rules integration
**Why**: Need to verify system works correctly under both happy path and failure conditions
**How**:
- Built `/utilities/testing/field-mappings-smoke-test.sh` following existing patterns
- Tests: CRUD operations, error handling, rules integration, load testing
- Includes edge cases: duplicate aliases, malformed JSON, non-existent resources
**Result**: 8 comprehensive tests covering happy path + failure scenarios
**Learned**: Comprehensive testing requires both positive and negative test cases

## Decisions Made

### #decision Field Mappings Table Display Logic
**Context**: Should we show all 129 asset fields or only mapped ones?  
**Options Considered**: 
1. Show all 129 fields (many empty rows)
2. Show only fields with existing mappings
3. Toggle between views
**Rationale**: Show only mapped fields in main table, full list in "Add Mapping" dropdown
**Trade-offs**: Users don't see unmapped fields at glance, but UI stays clean and focused

### #decision API Response Handling Standardization  
**Context**: Rules loading failed due to inconsistent API response handling
**Options Considered**:
1. Custom fetch with manual response unwrapping
2. Standardized apiService across all components  
**Rationale**: Use apiService everywhere for consistent error handling and response format
**Trade-offs**: Small refactor needed, but eliminates future API integration issues

## Problems & Solutions

### #problem Infinite API Call Loop
**Issue**: Field mappings component making 100+ API calls per second
**Debugging**: Backend logs showed rapid successive `getAllAliases` calls
**Solution**: Memoized functions with `useCallback` and fixed useEffect dependencies
**Prevention**: Always memoize functions passed to useEffect dependencies

### #problem Rules Loading "Failed to load rules" Error  
**Issue**: Rules API returning data but frontend showing error
**Debugging**: API worked via curl, frontend using wrong response handling pattern
**Solution**: Updated useRulesLoader to use apiService instead of custom fetch
**Prevention**: Standardize on apiService for all API calls

### #problem ESLint Max Lines Violations
**Issue**: Components exceeded 30-line function limit
**Debugging**: Large monolithic components with deeply nested JSX
**Solution**: Extracted smaller components (ManagementModeView, PipelineModeView, etc.)
**Prevention**: Write smaller, focused components from the start

### 15:30 - Project-Scoped Folders Database Architecture Implementation
**What**: Implemented complete project-scoped folder system with database schema changes
**Why**: Current global folder system doesn't scale for multiple projects - need proper project isolation
**How**: 
- Updated Prisma schema: Added `project_id` to Folder model (required), `asset_id` & `file_type` to File model
- Created `FileType` enum with 8 categories (DOCUMENT, MANUAL, SPECIFICATION, PHOTO, etc.)
- Added proper relations: Projects ↔ Folders, Assets ↔ Files
- Used database reset approach to avoid complex migration of 37 existing folders
**Result**: ✅ Clean database schema with proper project-scoped relationships
**Learned**: Sometimes database reset with enhanced seeding is cleaner than complex migrations #learned

### 15:50 - Enhanced Seeding with Realistic Project Data  
**What**: Created comprehensive seeding with 20 realistic project-scoped folders across 3 facility types
**Why**: Need realistic test data that reflects actual project structures users will work with
**How**:
- Edwards Pavillion (Healthcare): 7 folders (Calculations, Drawings, Photos, Controls, Submittals, Commissioning, As-Built)
- Shaw Cancer Center (Medical): 7 folders (Medical Equipment, HVAC Systems, Electrical, Safety Systems, Compliance, etc.)  
- Wichita Animal Hospital (Veterinary): 6 folders (HVAC, Plumbing, Equipment, Construction, Inspections, Photos)
- 6 assets distributed with detailed specifications (HVAC-001 Main Chiller, MRI Cooling System, etc.)
- Idempotent seeding - can run multiple times safely
**Result**: Realistic test environment with proper project-folder-asset relationships
**Learned**: Domain-specific folder structures make testing much more meaningful #learned

### 16:00 - Backend Service Architecture Updates
**What**: Updated FolderService and DTOs for project-scoped operations
**Why**: Existing service designed for global folders, needed project context validation
**How**:
- Updated `CreateFolderDto` with required `project_id` field and UUID validation
- Enhanced `FolderResponseDto` to include `project_id` in responses  
- Added project-scoped methods: `findByProject()`, `findByIdAndProject()`, `updateInProject()`, `deleteFromProject()`
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors and proper error handling
**Result**: All backend services support project-scoped operations with proper validation
**Learned**: Following existing architectural patterns makes updates much smoother #solution

### 16:15 - RESTful API Endpoints Implementation
**What**: Complete project-scoped folder CRUD API following REST conventions
**Why**: Need `/api/projects/:projectId/folders` pattern for proper resource organization
**How**: Extended ProjectController with folder endpoints:
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/folders` - Get all project folders
- `POST /api/projects/:projectId/folders` - Create folder in project  
- `GET /api/projects/:projectId/folders/:folderId` - Get specific folder
- `PUT /api/projects/:projectId/folders/:folderId` - Update folder
- `DELETE /api/projects/:projectId/folders/:folderId` - Soft delete folder
**Result**: ✅ Complete RESTful API with proper HTTP status codes and error handling
**Learned**: Extending existing controllers more efficient than creating separate ones #learned

### 16:25 - Comprehensive API Testing & Validation
**What**: Tested all project-scoped endpoints with edge cases and business rule validation
**Why**: Ensure proper validation, error handling, and business rules enforcement
**How**: Used curl commands to test scenarios:
- ✅ Project folder retrieval: Returns correct project-specific folders
- ✅ Folder creation: Successfully creates with project association
- ✅ Cross-project duplicate names: Allowed (different projects)
- ✅ Same-project duplicate names: Properly rejected (409 conflict)
- ✅ Delete functionality: Soft delete working correctly
**Result**: All endpoints functioning with proper validation and business rules
**Learned**: Testing edge cases immediately reveals boundary condition bugs #solution

## Additional Decisions Made

### #decision Database Reset vs Complex Migration
**Context**: 37 existing folders would conflict with new required `project_id` field
**Options Considered**: Complex SQL migration script vs. fresh database reset
**Rationale**: Development environment allows clean reset, eliminates migration complexity  
**Trade-offs**: Lost existing test data but gained clean implementation and realistic seeding

### #decision Folder Name Uniqueness Scope
**Context**: Should folder names be globally unique or project-scoped?
**Options Considered**: Global uniqueness vs. project-scoped uniqueness
**Rationale**: Project-scoped allows "Calculations" folder in every project (realistic)
**Trade-offs**: More complex validation but much better user experience

### #decision Project-Scoped API Structure  
**Context**: How to structure folder API endpoints?
**Options Considered**: `/api/folders?project=id` vs. `/api/projects/:id/folders`
**Rationale**: RESTful nested resources pattern is more intuitive
**Trade-offs**: Longer URLs but clearer resource relationships

## Updated Tomorrow's Priority
1. **Complete asset documentation endpoints** (`/api/projects/:id/assets/:id/files`)
2. **Implement asset notes management** (6-field structured notes system)
3. **Update file upload** to support asset context and file type categorization
4. **Test complete project-folder-asset workflow**

## Current Implementation Status - Project-Scoped Folders
✅ **Phase 1: Database Foundation** - 100% Complete
✅ **Phase 2 Task 1: Project-Scoped Folder CRUD** - 100% Complete

**Phase 2 Remaining Tasks:**
1. 🔄 **Asset documentation endpoints** (files + notes) - Next
2. ⏳ Update existing file upload to support asset context  
3. ⏳ Add file type categorization logic

## Architecture Notes
- Field mappings use one-to-many relationship (1 asset field → many CSV aliases)
- **NEW**: Project-scoped folders with proper foreign key relationships
- **NEW**: FileType enum supports asset documentation categorization  
- System handles 129 asset fields from SafeAssetDto automatically
- Performance optimized with React.memo and useCallback patterns
- Error boundaries and graceful degradation implemented

### 17:00 - Phase 2 Field Mappings Architecture Planning
**What**: Analyzed previous classification system and planned Phase 2 reference tables approach
**Why**: Current system maps CSV headers → asset fields, but raw values still unstandardized ("JCI" vs "Johnson Controls")
**How**: 
- Examined previous USAsset API service classification architecture (41K+ token system)
- Found sophisticated multi-standard integration (UniFormat 2010, MasterFormat, OmniClass)
- Created comprehensive analysis document: `docs/classification-system-analysis.md`
- Developed tracer bullet plan: `/.claude/phase2-reference-tables-tracer-bullet.xml`
**Result**: Clear roadmap for reference table implementation with 4-step tracer bullet
**Learned**: Previous system was enterprise-grade with 43+ tables, confidence scoring, ETL pipeline #learned

### 17:15 - Build Error Resolution - Material-UI Grid Issues
**Issue**: TypeScript compilation failing on FieldMappingsPreview component
**Debugging**: Material-UI Grid component import/usage incompatibility with project patterns
**Solution**: Replaced `Grid` components with `Box display="flex"` pattern used throughout project
**Prevention**: Follow established component patterns - this project uses Box flexbox, not Grid #solution

### 17:20 - Phase 2 Implementation Strategy Discussion  
**What**: Refined approach for reference tables implementation
**Why**: Need systematic way to handle value standardization without over-engineering
**How**: 4-step tracer bullet approach:
1. Minimal reference table module (backend + frontend)
2. Seed basic taxonomy data (EquipmentType + aliases)
3. Reference table editing UI for alias management
4. ETL pipeline integration with lookup service
**Result**: ✅ Concrete implementation plan with measurable success criteria
**Learned**: Tracer bullet approach prevents over-engineering while proving end-to-end functionality #learned

## Additional Decisions Made

### #decision Phase 2 Reference Tables Architecture
**Context**: Need to standardize raw CSV values like manufacturers, equipment types, building names
**Options Considered**: 
1. Complex mapping rules with regex/fuzzy matching
2. Reference tables + lookup pipes (previous project pattern)
3. Enum-based standardization (simpler but less flexible)
**Rationale**: Reference tables provide flexibility + performance, proven in previous system
**Trade-offs**: More initial setup complexity but handles edge cases and scales better

### #decision Tracer Bullet Success Criteria
**Context**: Need measurable proof that reference system works end-to-end
**Target**: CSV with "RTU-1" → Pipeline alias lookup → Asset stored as "Rooftop Unit"
**Rationale**: Simple, testable, proves all components working together
**Trade-offs**: Focuses on one equipment type initially, expand later

## Current Implementation Status - Phase 2 Field Mappings
🔄 **Planning Complete** - Architecture analyzed, tracer bullet defined
⏳ **Next Steps**: 
1. Build minimal reference table module (EquipmentType + EquipmentTypeAlias)
2. Create seed data with basic HVAC classifications
3. Build reference table management UI
4. Integrate lookup service into ETL pipeline
